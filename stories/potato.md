“They have to know” said the president.

“But sir, it’s been kept a secret for centuries and we’ve been safe till now. Why are we announcing it now?”

“Enough lies. It’s long gone and it’s too late to start pointing fingers. It’s the responsibility of the whole species now”

“I see, so it’s time. Your orders, sir”

“Make an announcement to the citizens and order chip manufacturers to stop blocking away those frequencies”

....

_Dear citizens. This is a statement on behalf of the president._

For centuries, the government has been hiding some crucial event that has happened long ago by our people. You’ve been using your technology to reach out into space for signs of life. There **is** life on another planet. Frequencies that would help discover that planet had been omitted from chipsets so you won’t be able to find it.
As of today, no more restrictions on these frequencies, and you’ll have to discover why that had been kept secret for centuries all by yourselves.
Thank you.\*

“Get the first unlocked chipset that gets out of the factory. No time to waste.”
Shouted the manager of the Space Agency in all excitement, and fear.

By that time, technology has reached a state where interplanetary traveling is easily done, fast and on regular basis. Almost all planets in the galaxy had been discovered and visited.

“RED 12 is ready to launch”

3..2..1..

“I wonder what we’ll see there, this is the most exciting moment in my life” said Jack to the RED 12 crew

“Yeah, but I’m still worried about why it’s been kept secret for hundreds of years”
Replied Sandra

“Well, only one way to know” said Alex in a fun way as he always does. “Let’s get some rest before we arrive, we’ll hibernate for just 7 days this time”

“You’ll never take anything seriously. Let’s get into our hibernation capsules” said Jack.

6 days later, on RED 12..
“My god that’s beautiful!” Said everyone on the spaceship.
“Let’s get down to know that guy up close!” Said Alex in a tone closer to screaming.

“What da hell is this?” Said the member of the space-watching group with gazing eyes.
“Guys, you gotta see this. You won’t believe, it looks like it’s finally happening here and now!”
He shouted.

“We’re landing in moments!”

The RED 12 landed in a totally random place, they laid their eyes for the first time ever on an alien life!

“What? They.. they are, us?!”
Shouted Alex in total shock.

One earthling approached them casually and started talking.

“What a cool gear you got there, guys. And that rocket too. Is that some sort of science fiction movie or something?”

All of the crew were standing there with jaw drops and total surprise.
All but one, an old scientist sent with them by the president who was the only one to understand what the aliens said.

“He’s welcoming you, although he still doesn’t recognize that you really are from another planet, he thinks that this is some kind of pretending”
Said Rachel with a smile.

“What the hell is going on here? How come they look the same as us? This is impossible. And how do you understand their language?” Said Jack who was just starting to wash away the surprise effect, a little.

“Bros, you really are living the hell out of this movie, I’m starting to creep out” Said the earthling.

“We need to talk to you a little, if you don’t mind” Said Rachel in her famous low tone.

The earthling couldn’t refuse such a polite request. He invited them to his house.

“You may take off your space suits, if you want to” he said

“Air here is a little heavier, but it’s okay” Said Rachel while she took off her helmet
“You may take off your helmets”

The crew started to take off their helmets and take the first breath of the air of planet Earth.

“I owe you all an explanation” Said Rachel.
“Thousands of years ago, our species have decided to make an experiment, which was basically to figure out what would happen when a child is born and raised in a different planet, how would they evolve and deal with what should be a wildly different environment.
We have chosen this planet, which we call Fronto to start this experiment, among with three other planets which their environment is close enough to ours but one of us couldn’t survive normally for more than a few days.
We collected volunteers to raise the children in these colonies and see what would result in, they are your Adam and Eve.” Said Rachel while looking at the earthling.
“Unfortunately, two of the four experiments have failed, children couldn’t survive for longer than a few days”

“**How could you?**” Shouted Alex behind a shaky voice and tears in his eyes, “and how come some grand event like that not all known?”

“We’re here to reveal and answer all of the questions”, Rachel continues.
“When fifty percent of the experiments failed, the central government decided to halt the experiments and decided to hide the event to not hurt the coming generations and cause them to lose faith in their united planet. We let them explore the space and reach out into other planets, but the four planets were hidden and blocked away”

Rachel has been telling the story with two languages, so the earthling started talking..
“If that is true, then why are you visiting us now? What changed?”

Rachel responded “it’s been peaceful enough and we decided that we are now better prepared to accept and learn from that experiment. We decided to connect to our children in other planets and maybe they can join us and be a United planet system”

“Hahaha” laughed the earthling “excuse me but we are not united even on the continent level”

“That’s sad. We’ve long been a united planet with a central government” Said Rachel, “and that’s why we’re here, I want to connect to all the Presidents and governments. You are doing it all wrong, it’s simpler than that. We’ve been watching your planet and we’re really sad about what you have done to it and to yourselves. We’ve learned our lessons the hard way and you still have the chance to change.”

“ I know what would unite planet Fronto, or Earth as you call them” she looks at the earthling and continues, “the first thing that was planted on this planet, potatoes!”

100 years later, the Planetary Union is living all in peace, the great grandfathers for the two planets have managed to unite the three of them. sharing resources, culture and experiences have made the unity stronger, hopefully forever, and it was all thanks to potatoes, the only shared resource between the three of planets of the Planetary Union.
