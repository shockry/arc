The year is 2064, the world has changed a lot in the past 30 years as powerful countries became more powerful and things have gotten out of hand for most poor countries.

A new international law was agreed upon that poor countries are taken over by more powerful ones until they recover, and until then, all extra resources, money generated from projects and exports are owned by the powerful country.

It sounded like a good solution for countries that had no other solutions; the most important of those was Egypt..

Egypt has been struggling for the past 100 years and things just kept getting worse. So they chose to offer themselves to the bid.

World powers know that Egypt has a great potential and could generate a lot of revenue for them so the bid was so aggressive. At the end, the United Kingdom won, it is the most powerful of all and has the most countries and most money.

The United States -which owns the two americas now, except for Canada- didn’t like what happened and decided they wanted Egypt, and will take it, even if by force..

After 5 years between negotiations and armed battles, the world gets into what people called World War 3.

> A war to end all wars

Egypt is in the middle of it. The US decided to nuke Cairo. Because if they can’t have it, no one can, or that’s how people around the world interpreted the brutal act.

Egypt is still poor, government is focusing on building the infrastructure so they have no nuke-proof shelters. People just started running around making shelters out of everything they can. And a bunch of them entered the great pyramid hoping its underground rooms would protect them.

They got in and closed the rock door.

“Do you think this thing is going to hold against a nuclear bomb?” -asked Mario

“Even if it does. How in the bloody hell are we supposed to live in here for more than a few days?” - shouted Jackson

“Guys, shhh. Do you hear that?”

“I hear beeping. Probably someone’s phone is ringing”

“Are you insane? Do you realize that humanity almost wiped itself off the face of the earth? Signal towers are no more.”

- everybody started checking out their phones. No one has signal

“The sound is coming from there. Let’s just see what it is”

They listen carefully, the sound is similar to Morse code, it was a sound of beeps.

“That’s Morse code!” Said Natalie.

“But who would put a device to beep Morse codes here?” Asked Nasser.

“No, this is not Morse code. I know how to use it and this doesn’t mean anything to me” Said Jackson.

The group was desperate. Maybe there’s someone alive and is trying to communicate, maybe there’s a way out...

So they try to find clues in that code, and try, and try, but they just don’t understand what it means.

They start to lose hope.

“I know this sounds ridiculous, but look at this wall” Said Nasser while pointing his flashlight at it.

“Yeah hieroglyphs, what’s there to look at?” Said Jackson.

“No, look closely, only the hieroglyphs on this wall have dots beneath them. This could mean something, right? We’re hearing beeps, they hav dots” Replied Nasser

“So what? We don’t understand beeps or hieroglyphs” Replied Jackson

“The sound is coming from here” Natalie pointed to the bottom of the coffin while leaning inside

She decided to get inside to investigate it more. But once she stepped into the stone coffin, it’s bottom started to vibrate. She jumped out.

“What in the world is that?!”
Shouted Lara while watching the stone bottom slide open..

It revealed ten raised small, square stones, with a hieroglyphic symbol on each of them.

“Do you think there are BUTTONS?!” Asked Natalie

The beeping has stopped at this point.

“Guys does anyone remember what the beeps pattern was?” Asked Jackson

“I do, I also translated them into hieroglyphs if that’s what you’re after” Replied Nasser

“Yes, that’s exactly what I mean. Come on, let’s push these buttons in the same order, maybe that’s our way out to the rescue”.

They started pushing the buttons as the beeps instructed.

They hear a rumble then the ground started falling..

---

Everything stops. They find themselves in what looks like a very old operations room.

They start exploring around fascinated by what they are witnessing.

They see a wall that looks like a Rosetta Stone, but with many more languages.

“Can someone understand any of this?” Shouted Nasser while pointing to the wall.

“I think this is Ancient Greek. Let me see..” Said Lara after taking a look at the stone.

She spends some time translating what’s written on the wall.

She looks back at them with an open mouth and a shocked look on her face..

“What does it say?!” Asked Natalie in concern

> If you are reading this, you are some of the few people left on this planet. All pyramids on the planet are interconnected and they can detect the their surroundings. They are designed to initiate escape mechanics in disastrous situations.

> Those few that took them as shelters shall survive, the pyramids are designed to withstand any natural or manmade disaster.

> We live in a multiverse, this was our fifth attempt at building a sustainable civilization, but as you’re here, we know it failed to last. And it means that this planet is no longer suitable for living.

> The pyramids are designed to take you into the next universe, where the odds of survival could be more in your favor.

> After launching the pyramid, you will be transported into another universe, you will still land on your planet, but you will have to start over. We chose universes where humans don’t exist, so you will have both a cleaner planet and unlimited possibilities.

> This is your only chance to live. You will find the instructions of how to travel to the next universe and how to leave this pyramid prepared to go to the next one if the sixth attempt failed.

“Guys we’re hallucinating, we haven’t eaten in three days” Said Nasser.

“No let’s give it a try, it’s worth a shot” Said Lara.

Everyone agreed.

They started operating the pyramid as per instructed, and it started moving to the new earth..

---

“Wow! That’s so beautiful!” Said Natalie while looking around upon arrival.

“So that’s what it looks like without us corrupting it. We need to treat it right this time.” Said Jackson

“Yeah, it’s our chance to start over and stay clean, no more pain and poverty, no more war and pollution. Let’s find the other survivors and start plotting a plan!” Said Nasser in excitement

Everyone nodded and smiled. A new hope for the human civilization...

> ...We live in a multiverse, this was our fifty third attempt at building a sustainable civilization, but as you’re here, we know it failed to last. And it means this planet is no longer suitable for living.

---

> ...We live in a multiverse, this was our ninety fourth attempt at building a sustainable civilization...

---

> We live in a multiverse, this was our two hundred and thirty fourth attempt at building a sustainable civilization...

> ...This is your only chance to live. You will find the instructions of how to travel to the next universe and how to leave this pyramid prepared to go to the next one if the next attempt failed.

“I’m not doing this” Said Martin

“Are you out of your mind? This could be our chance to live” Said Mia

“Look. We all know that this is the only pyramid on the planet, and we’re like a hundred people here. If we all decided we will not do it then all this will end.

How many more planets should we destroy? We’re destined to doom by our own hands, humans are evil and greedy by design, what will change if we continue? We will destroy another planet and another and will kill and harm each other once again.

We’re just an extension to the previous ones. Nothing will ever change. Enough with that, no more harm.” Said Martin, full of emotions, then he sighed
“I’m going outside, who’s coming with me?”

Everybody looked at each other in tears and replied “I’m going with you”.

And everything went silent..
