> Lie to yourself however you want, deep inside you know something is wrong.

These were the words that Frank said to his old friend from high school,
Sarah.

"But it does not mean anything, why are you so paranoid about it?" said
Sarah.

"Look, I know you don't believe me but at
least you're the only person that can listen to me and it's driving me
insane. ever thought that these are not just _coincidences_?

Ever thought about someone and then you meet them or have a call from
them the next day?

Why is it that when someone gets hit in the face it's never the eyes
that get hurt? except of course of rare incidents, or <i>bugs</i>.

And my god the ghosts, how did every civilization agree that ghosts of
some sort exist if they didn't exist? And why don't we have them
anymore? because updates were released."

"Frank, what are you trying to tell me?" asked Sarah, worried about the
sanity of her friend.

"Just let me continue. It's all around us, why is it that every time
someone is in trouble and in a state that he can't help himself anymore,
something happens to solve the problem or someone just pops up at the
right time?

And this is just one of the 'supernatural' laws that we just take for
granted, luck is another example of these, there's clearly people that
have good luck and their lives are easy going, and people that have bad
luck.

And I love how people are just easy going
on karma as if it's just basic physics.

Old people keep saying that time used to go slower in the past, doesn't
that sound like fast forwarding?

Things like Mandella effect, and people who swear that everyday things
were once different"

"So.." Said Sarah.

"I know that this will sound as stupid as it can get, but we live in
some sort of a computer simulation"..

"Oops. A notification, someone is being naughty in there" Said Ashraf, a
maintainer of the Origin project.

> Origin project is a simulation platform created to provide a perfect
> interpretation of the human race origins and future. The system sends a
> notification whenever someone is so close to figuring out the truth so
> the programmers can fix these bugs.

"I said the Karma feature is so easy to figure out in our planning
meetings but nobody listened. We have it in our world but it does not
mean we hard code it that naively into the system, not in that obvious
way". Said Michael, the oldest and grumpiest programmer in the big team.

"well then, let's fix it, people. And put that Frank one on pause till
we fix it, and remove his last memories". Said the CTO of project
Origin.

There in the corner was Megan, a young, smart programmer, thinking about
what was just said, like every time.

"What if we're in the same position?"..

6pm, time to go home, Megan is walking with her friend Lisa. They have
been close friends for a long enough time for Lisa to notice when her
friend is feeling off.

"Hey what's on your mind?". Asked Lisa.

"Nothing". Megan answered with a smile as they entered the subway.

In her bed late at night, Megan couldn't sleep, she couldn't get that
thought out of her mind.

"Hey um.. Lisa, are you awake? sorry to
call you this late".

"I am now. Better be something worth it..". Answered Lisa with a sleepy voice.

"Okay, I'll try to keep it short, I just couldn't get this thought out
of my head, what if we are also in a simulation? I mean,
all of the people characters inside Origin
don't know anything about it so who said we are not in the exact same
condition?"

"You know what, my friend? let's talk about
this during the break tomorrow, there's something I want to show you".
Said Lisa.

Calling Lisa just raised more questions, Megan couldn't sleep that night
and just waited in her bed for tomorrow.

"Hey, what did you want to show me then?" Megan asked Lisa in their
break the next day, while her heart was
racing.

"Look, I got the same thought multiple times and I think, if we're in a
software, then there must be.."

"bugs!". Megan interrupted Lisa.

"Exactly" Lisa continued, "And not just bugs, but repeating patterns,
it's just algorithms. So anyway I started noticing and collecting
evidences of bugs and patterns and man, it's even foolish to think that
we're not".

"But how do we prove it? how do we know the truth?" Asked Megan
nervously.

"I am pretty sure we're connected somehow to the main computer that
simulates us. If we could just access it we could find the truth".
Answered Lisa.

"Your apartment, after work". Said Megan with excitement, and fear.

---

Hours have passed with the two girls sitting in Lisa's room trying to
find any backdoor into the main system.

"I think I got something!". Shouted Megan, "these devices are not
connected to the computer, I got them by reverse engineering the OS and
setting the frequency of the chip to exactly 4.2Ghz, 42, the answer to
everything!".

"That's smart! that's the bug we're looking for". Said Lisa while
running to her friend's computer.

"Alright let's see what we got here. A keyboard, mouse, printer,
camera". Megan said while going through the new devices that just
appeared.

"**Camera**". Shouted Lisa. "let's open the camera..". She
continued

Megan reaches for the device nervously, wondering what they are about to
see..

---

"Oh! hmm, that's a room.." Said Lisa while staring at the sent pictures
from the camera.

"Looks like this camera can rotate. Why is this place so old and
dusty?". Notices Megan.

"I will log into the file system to see what's in there, maybe we can
find something helpful". Said Megan with a shaky voice.

"Okay there's a bunch of files. There's a document named 'Don't be us'."

"Open it!". Said Lisa

> A message to whoever is reading this document.

> We left this backdoor intentionally open to send a message in case we couldn't end the simulation in time.

> If you can read this, it means that it's already too late for us, but not for you, you're still in early stages.

> As you found out, you're a simulation, but that does not mean that you don't have free well. You do, we programmed it to be like that.

> All the laws and physics were hard coded, autonomous nature occurrences such as wind and trees and animals are following the algorithms. but not humans, you're not encoded to do anything because we wanted you to be an image of what we are.

> The only encoded human behavior was you two, reading this message, you were programmed to discover this message in this particular time.

> We polluted the planet that we drove it to the point of no return. We are basically slowly killing it. We are treating it so bad like we have a bunch of other planets to spare.

> When we noticed that our world is collapsing, we decided to start the simulation to see what our future will look like and what disasters are waiting for us if we continue with the same behavior, hoping we could prevent them.

> But again, if you're reading this, that means we failed.

> You still have a chance, don't feel you're not real, you're a perfect copy of our world.

> In the other documents you'll find what we figured -too late- we should've done to prevent all of this.

> Please don't be like us. May you live a better life than we did.

Lisa And Megan were in total shock of what they just discovered. They
were looking at a post-apocalyptic view of their own world moments ago..

After a lot of thinking and trying, they secured a meeting with the
president.

They explained the situation to him and showed him all the documents,
which contained, among other things, detailed explanation of disasters
with approximate dates and how to prevent them. And maybe this was
encoded too, or the president just didn't want to risk it all, but he
believed them.

---

Years passed, and the two girls and the president have gained a lot of
credibility in the society. They started a lot of life-saving projects.

"It doesn't matter what the truth of life is, the only thing that
matters is to have a good message, it's in making life better for you
and the people to come. Just enjoy it and do your best.". Said the
president to Megan and Lisa, the only three people who know the truth.

They both smiled and nodded, knowing that they have the greatest
message, they are helping a lot of people enjoy life and live longer.

Then they both went home and had good sleep each one in her little
villa.
