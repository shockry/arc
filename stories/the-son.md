“No, don’t leave me. You are all I have left”
Behind tears like rain said Amanda while her son died between her arms.

She would do anything to get him back. She has read about time lanes and how they work; they meant that in another time lane her son is not dead, he is living, smiling and hugging her.

Amanda decided to dedicate her life just to spend the rest of it with her son. She began studying and researching, she never slept.

She has managed to know how everything works after fitting all the pieces together. She figured out how to travel between time lanes but she didn’t know how to return or even choose the lane she wanted. And that was enough for her as she just wanted to be with her son, she would just pick one random lane and live with her son forever seeing him grow in front of her eyes as she always wanted.

The time has come to the experiment, she prepared all the necessary gear and got ready to cross to the other lane.

She felt paralyzed and felt her body itching, everything went black for an unknown period of time.

She felt her body again but the darkness remained. She could hear her son calling her, she wanted to see him too bad, she tried to reach him but it’s all darkness. She has lost her sight, her son is right in front of her but she can’t see him, she couldn’t take it. She decided she would try another lane, one where she could see her son becoming a man.

She went ahead and repeated what she did. Again she felt paralyzed and her body itched but this time she could see, she found herself in a rusty old house in a poor suburb, her son was there but that’s not the man she raised, he was a bully, drug addict cursing his mom and the way they are living, how helpless she is and how ignorant she is for not doing anything to him. She didn’t hear a word he said, she was looking at him, he’s alive, she went ahead to hug him but he threw her down and left. He is alive, but not her son anymore. She couldn’t take it so she decided to try her luck one more time.

At that point she knew what was happening, every time she crosses to a different time lane she loses something, in the original she lost her son, then she lost her sight and finally it was her job and her caring for the child.

She knew it was dangerous, but her love for her son was strong enough to make another try to get their peaceful life again.

She went ahead, again paralyzed and itches until she arrived. She couldn’t understand what was happening, she looked right at him but she couldn’t figure out what he was, he kissed her and went out. Her guard was busy dealing with someone at the door when she went to the kitchen, she was thirsty so she drank from a bottle on the sink, she doesn’t understand what is written on it, she dies within minutes, it was bleach.

Her son returns home, he cries and hugs her. “No, don’t leave me. You are all I have left”

He looks at her chair and notices a weird box, it was his mother’s gear for crossing time lanes. It had a paper with the instructions and detailed explanation about how it’s done.

He couldn’t believe what he is reading but driven by love, he decides to shoot for a lane where his mother is alive and well.

He prepares for his first attempt.

He feels paralyzed and his body itches, then he lost all of his senses, he felt nothing, nothing at all. He went to a time lane where he didn’t exist, where he dies between his mother’s arms as a child.
